# convolutional_neural_network

This is a simple neural network designed to distinguish between pictures of cats and dogs. In the .ipynb file, you can see the process in which I optimize few hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and l2 regularization rate. Optimized model is saved in a folder (you have to use the whole folder of course).
